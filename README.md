# fv-1 experiments

Experiments to learn SpinASM - used to program FV-1 DSP chip

The experiments are listed below, the check box indicates if the particular experiment is complete or to be tackled

- [ ] incomplete
- [x] complete

## Assumption

I'll assume that you have an FV-1 development board. It is possible to program the external EEProm in other ways, but I can't help you there. 

## Fundamentals

- [ ] Running SpinASM IDE on a Mac
- [x] Connecting your FV-1 to your windows machine
- [ ] loading program onto EEprom using development board SPIN1001

[Fundamentals writeups](./fundamentals/readme.md)

## Simple

- [ ] pass-through
- [ ] Volume control
- [ ] High pass filter
